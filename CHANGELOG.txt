Release 2.0
===========

* Dario Teixeira and Jacques-Pascal Deplaix: fixing issues with arrays.
  This requires all array types to change from 'a array to 'a option array,
  which breaks backward compatibility.
* Dario Teixeira's patch making PostgreSQL's NUMERIC type be converted
  to/from OCaml strings.  This change is not backward's compatible,
  requiring a bump in the major version number (though there seems
  to be no actual code in the wild relying on the previous behaviour).
* Dario Teixeira's patch adding function 'uuid', which exposes the
  unique connection handle identifier.
* Jacques-Pascal Deplaix's patches adding 'catch', 'transact', 'alive',
  'inject', and 'alter' functions.
* Jacques-Pascal Deplaix's patch removing all traces of ExtLib.
  (PG'OCaml now uses Batteries exclusively.)
